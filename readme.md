## Utilizing Houdini for Computational Design in Architecture

In these example files, we are gearing Houdini Python nodes to work with NumPy and NetworkX for path-finding and aggregation of environmental analyses in a generative design process. There are two functions that read geometric data from Houdini and translate them into NumPy arrays and the other way around.

Incorporating python numerical libraries within Houdini software package.
